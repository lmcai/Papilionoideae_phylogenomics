            Use BISSE.R for the analysis, key parameters include the sampling proportion for species with status 0 and 1.
3. BAMM
See http://bamm-project.org/advanced.html to accommodate missing data

5. 
* If ΔAIC < 2, then there is substantial support for the model with the lower AIC score.
* If 2 < ΔAIC < 6, then there is less support for the model with the higher AIC score.
* If ΔAIC > 6, then there is essentially no support for the model with the higher AIC score.
6. We performed marginal ancestral state reconstruction for marine and freshwater habitat across the species tree using hidden state speciation and extinction models in the R package hisse (Beaulieu and O’Meara 2016)
